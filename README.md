# Introduction

This project uses the open data about Parks and Recreation Facilities in XML format from (city of Toronto)[https://open.toronto.ca/]. The objective of the project is
- [x] To use XLST to display information about a particular park (park location #9).
- [x] Create a drop-down form using Javascript DOM. When the user selects any park name from the drop-down list, and clicks the "View Details" submit button, the information about the park is then displayed.

> XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) is used to to display or transform XML in a different way. These transformations can be such things as changing the XML to a different XML format or displaying or XML data as HTML.

> Similar to the HTML DOM, the XML DOM, too, is a tree representation of your XML document. You can manipulate your XML document via the DOM using different programming languages.
